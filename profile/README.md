Hello there! I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in creating efficient and scalable applications. With over 5 years of experience in software development, I specialize in full-stack development, primarily using JavaScript frameworks such as React and Node.js, along with Python for backend processing.

I've had the opportunity to work extensively with various databases including MongoDB and PostgreSQL, enabling me to build robust data-driven applications. My workflows often incorporate RESTful APIs and GraphQL, allowing seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

I believe in clean code, and I strive to follow best practices in software development. I am a strong advocate of Agile methodologies and have experience working in dynamic environments that require adaptability and collaboration among cross-functional teams.

When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, contributing to open source projects, or indulging my curiosity through various coding challenges. I am always eager to learn and embrace new technologies that can help enhance my developing skills.

Here are some of my pinned repositories that showcase my skills and projects:

- [Project One](https://github.com/vickysimpson992/project-one): A full-stack web application built with React and Node.js.
- [Project Two](https://github.com/vickysimpson992/project-two): A machine learning application using Python and TensorFlow.
- [Project Three](https://github.com/vickysimpson992/project-three): A simple yet efficient personal blog platform leveraging Next.js.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and I welcome any feedback or collaboration opportunities. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
